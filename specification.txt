Brief (one-sentence) description of how you chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap:
Admittedly I completely forgot to work on it the evening I planned to finish it up and remembered last minute
and only had an hour ish to get some things fixed so I did not implement JS in a comprehensive way nor did I
utilize bootstrap correctly to ensure my nav bar is responsive for mobile devices and the site is missing info
in general so I understand that this will take points off as I couldn’t get that done before the due date but
I will definitely go back and fix those things after submitted.
